\begin{abstract}

Heavy quarks nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) has been proposed as an important measurement to study the flavor dependence of partons energy loss in the medium, and eventually to help in extracting the medium transport, drag and diffusion coefficients.

% We report the first measurement of efficiency corrected spectrum for $D^0$ from HFT through the hadronic channels ($D^0(\bar{D^0}) \rightarrow K^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}$), the Nuclear Modification Factor ($R_{AA}$) of $D^0$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The precision was much better compared to previous published one. The new $R_{AA}$ results show significant suppression at high $p_T$ which means the strong interaction between charm quark and the medium and loose energy. While the $D^0$ $R_{AA}$ shows quite similar trend as light hadrons.

We report measurements of $D^0$-meson production at mid-rapidity ($|y|<$1) in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200\,GeV utilizing the Heavy Flavor Tracker, high resolution silicon detector at the STAR experiment. $D^0$-mesons are reconstructed via their hadronic decay channel $D^0\rightarrow K^-+\pi^+$ and its charge conjugate via topological reconstruction of $D^0$ decay vertices. After corrected for the detector acceptance, tracking and geometric selection efficiency, invariant yields of $D^0$-mesons are reported in various centrality bins covering a transverse momentum region of $0-8$ GeV/$c$. Nuclear modification factors ($R_{\rm CP}$) are obtained and compared to various phenomenological model calculations. Physics implications on charm hadron production and charm quark dynamics in the Quark-Gluon Plasma are discussed.

\section{Validation with Ks Spectra Measurement}
 To verify the data-driven fast-simulation procedures, we calculated the efficiency corrected spectra for $K_{s}$ in 10-20\% centralities using the data-driven methods. The result shows very good agreement with the published result as in Fig.~\ref{Ks_spectra}. The lower panel shows the double ratio comparison between run 14 and the published one.
