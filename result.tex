\subsection{\label{result:pt}$p_{\rm T}$ Spectra and Integrated Yields}

Figure~\ref{figure:D0_spectra} shows the efficiency corrected $D^0$ invariant yield at mid-rapidity ($|y|<1$) vs. transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in 0--10\%, 10--20\%, 20--40\%, 40--60\%, 60--80\% and 0--80\% Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 200\,GeV. $D^0$ invariant spectra in some centrality bins are arbitrarily scaled with factors indicated on the plot for clarity. Dashed lines depict fits to these spectra with the following Levy function

\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2N}{2\pi p_{\rm T}dp_{\rm T}dy} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{dN}{dy}\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{nT(nT+m_0(n-2))}\bigg(1+\frac{\sqrt{p_{\rm T}^2+m_0^2}-m_0}{nT}\bigg)^{-n}
\end{equation}

where $m_0$ is the $D^0$ particle mass and $\frac{dN}{dy}$, $T$ and $n$ are the free parameters. The Levy function fit shows nice descriptions to the $D^0$ spectra in all centrality bins up to 8\,GeV/$c$.

\subsection{\label{result:collectivity}Collectivity}

\subsubsection{\label{result:collectivity:mT}$m_{\rm T}$ Spectra}

Transverse mass spectra have often used to study the collectivity of produced hadrons in heavy-ion collisions. Figure~\ref{figure:mTFit_D0} shows the $D^{0}$ invariant yield at mid-rapidity ($|y|<1$) vs. transverse kinetic energy ($m_{\rm T}$ - $m_{0}$) for different centrality classes in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 200\,GeV, where $m_{\rm T} = \sqrt{p_{\rm T}^2+m_0^2}$ and $m_0$ is the $D^0$ meson mass. Solid and dashed black lines depict exponential function fits to various centrality bins up to $m_{\rm T} = 3m_{0}$ and the fit function is shown below

\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2N}{2\pi m_{\rm T}dm_{\rm T}dy} = \frac{dN/dy}{2\pi T_{\rm eff}(m_0+T_{\rm eff})}e^{-(m_{\rm T}-m_0)/T_{\rm eff}}
\end{equation}

A power-law function (shown below) is also used to fit the spectrum in 60--80\% centrality bin. 

\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2N}{2\pi p_{\rm T}dp_{\rm T}dy} = \frac{dN}{dy}\frac{4(n-1)(n-2)}{2\pi (n-3)^2\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle ^2}\bigg(1+\frac{2p_{\rm T}}{\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle (n-3)}\bigg)^{-n}
\end{equation}

where $dN/dy$, $\langle p_{\rm T}\rangle$, and $n$ are three free parameters. 

The power-law function fit shows a better description to the 60--80\% centrality data indicating the $D^0$ meson production in this peripheral bin is close to the perturbative QCD feature. The $D^0$ meson spectra in more central collisions can be well described by the expotential function fit suggesting the $D^0$ mesons have gained collectivity in the medium evolution in these collisions.

Figure~\ref{figure:Teff_D0} shows the $m_{\rm T}$ spectra slope parameter $T_{\rm eff}$ (obtained from the expontential fit described above) vs. collision centrality. Statistical and point-to-point systematic uncertainties, but no global systematic uncertainties, are added quadratically when performing the expontial fit. Therefore uncertainties shown in this plot are the total uncertainties on this fit parameter. The obtained $T_{\rm eff}$ parameter increases from peripheral to central collisions, suggesting more collectivity that $D^0$ mesons gain in more central collisions.

\end{figure}


Blast-wave model is extensively used to study the particle kinetic freeze-out properties. 

Assuming a hard-sphere uniform density particle source with a kinetic freeze-out temperature $T_{\rm kin}$ and a transverse radial flow velocity $\beta$, the particle transverse momentum spectral shape is given by :

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{p_{\rm T}dp_{\rm T}} = \frac{dN}{m_{\rm T}dm_{\rm T}} \propto \int_0^R rdr m_{\rm T} I_0\bigg(\frac{p_{\rm T}\sinh\rho}{T_{\rm kin}}\bigg) K_1\bigg(\frac{m_{\rm T}\cosh\rho}{T_{\rm kin}}\bigg)
\end{equation}

where $\rho = \tanh^{-1}\beta$, and $I_0$ and $K_1$ are the modified Bessel functions. The flow velocity profile is taken as

\begin{equation}
\beta = \beta_{\rm S}\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^{n}
\end{equation}

where $\beta_{\rm S}$ is the maximum velocity at the surface and $r/R$ is the relative radial position in the thermal source. The choice of $R$ only affects the overall spectrum magnitude while the spectrum shape constrains the three free parameters $T_{\rm kin}$, $\langle\beta\rangle=2/(2+n)\beta_{\rm S}$ and $n$.


To account for the degree of non-equilibrium, Tsallis statistics has been introduced into the Blast-wave model with an additional parameter $q-1$, and the Blast-Wave distribution can be modified as

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{m_{\rm T}dm_{\rm T}} \propto m_{\rm T}\int_{-Y}^{+Y}\cosh(y)dy \int_{-\pi}^{+\pi} d\phi \int_0^R rdr \bigg(1+\frac{q-1}{T_{\rm kin}}\big(m_{\rm T}\cosh(y)\cosh(\rho)-p_{\rm T}\sinh(\rho)\cos(\phi)\big)\bigg)^{\textstyle -\frac{1}{q-1}}
\end{equation}

In the limit of $q\rightarrow 1$, the TBW distribution returns to the regular Blast-Wave one. The new Tsallis Blast-Wave (TBW) model has been used to fit the RHIC light and strange hadron spectra and it shows nice description of these particle spectra up to 3 GeV/$c$.

The statistical and systematic uncertainties are shown as error bars and brackets on the data points.

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{figure:D0_Rcp} shows the calculated $R_{\rm CP}$ for several different centralities including 0-10\%, 10-20\%, 20-40\% and 40-60\%, here the base line is the most peripheral collisions 60-80\%. In the top panel, the band around unity was the vertex contribution for the systematic uncertainties from the most peripheral collisions at 60-80\%, these contribution also applied for the other $R_{\rm CP}$ centrality species. As a comparison, there are also three samples shown for charged hadrons, pions and protons in the top 10\% centrality. Bottom panels show the similar $R_{\rm CP}$ but for the other centralities.

\subsection{\label{result:theory}Comparison to Models}

Over the past several years, there have been rapid developments in the theory model calculations 

The Duke model uses a Langevin stochastic simulation to trace the charm quark propagation inside the QGP medium. Both collisional energy loss and radiative energy loss have been included in the calculation and charm quarks are hardronized via a hybrid approach combining both coalescence and fragmentation mechanisms. The bulk medium is simulated using a viscous hydrodynamic evoluation for the QGP evoluation and a hadronic cascede evolution using the UrQMD model. The charm quark in-medium interaction is characterized using a temperature and momentum dependent diffusion coefficient. The medium evoluation parameters have been constrained via a statistical Bayesian analysis by fitting the previous experimental data of $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_{2}$ of light, strange and charm hadrons. The extracted charm quark spatial diffusion coefficient at zero momentum $2\pi TD_s|_{p=0}$ is about 1--3 near $T_{\rm c}$ and exhibits a positive slope for its temperature dependence above $T_{\rm c}$.

The Linearized Boltzmann Transport (LBT) calculation extends the LBT approach developed before to include both light and heavy flavor parton evoluation in the QGP medium. The transport calculation includes all $2\rightarrow 2$ elastic scattering processes for collisional energy loss and the higher-twist energy loss formalism for medium induced radiative energy loss. It uses the same hybrid approach as in the Duke model for charm quark hadronization. The heavy quark transport is coupled with a 3D viscous hydrodynamic evolution which is tuned for light flavor hadron data. The charm quark spatial diffusion coefficient is estimated via the $2\pi TD_s =8\pi/\hat{q}$ at parton momentum $p = 10$\,GeV/$c$. The $2\pi TD_s$ is $\sim$3 at $T_{\rm c}$ and increases to $\sim$6 at $T = 500$\,MeV.

We compare our measured $R_{\rm CP}$ to several theory model calculations, shown in Fig.~\ref{}. 

\subsection{\label{result:totalCC} Total ccbar cross section}

Relay on the current charm related analysis, there is a nature question regarding on the total charm cross section. So using the current D0, Dpm, Dstar and Lc results and also relay on some theory prediction for the non-measured pt range. The detail slides can be found below: and We are using 10-40\% centrality for this testing.
