\subsection{\label{result:pt}$p_{\rm T}$ Spectra and Integrated Yields}

Figure~\ref{D0_spectra} shows the efficiency corrected $D^0$ invariant yield at mid-rapidity ($|y|<1$) vs. transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in 0--10\%, 10--20\%, 20--40\%, 40--60\%, 60--80\% and 0--80\% Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 200\,GeV. $D^0$ invariant spectra in some centrality bins are arbitrarily scaled with factors indicated on the plot for clarity. Dashed lines depict fits to these spectra with the following Levy function

\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2N}{2\pi p_{\rm T}dp_{\rm T}dy} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{dN}{dy}\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{nT(nT+m_0(n-2))}\bigg(1+\frac{\sqrt{p_{\rm T}^2+m_0^2}-m_0}{nT}\bigg)^{-n}
\end{equation}

where $m_0$ is the $D^0$ particle mass and $\frac{dN}{dy}$, $T$ and $n$ are the free parameters. The Levy function fit shows nice descriptions to the $D^0$ spectra in all centrality bins up to 8\,GeV/$c$.

After got the efficiency corrected pt spectra, the integrated $D^0$ yield was also obtained as shown in the next equation.

  d\sigma = \sum \frac{dN_{i}}{dy}\frac{1}{Events}\frac{1}{N_{bin}} * 42e^3 * 0.0388

\subsection{\label{result:collectivity}Collectivity}

\subsubsection{\label{result:collectivity:mT}$m_{\rm T}$ Spectra}

Transverse mass spectra have often used to study the collectivity of produced hadrons in heavy-ion collisions. Figure~\ref{mTFit_D0} shows the $D^{0}$ invariant yield at mid-rapidity ($|y|<1$) vs. transverse kinetic energy ($m_{\rm T}$ - $m_{0}$) for different centrality classes in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 200\,GeV, where $m_{\rm T} = \sqrt{p_{\rm T}^2+m_0^2}$ and $m_0$ is the $D^0$ meson mass. Solid and dashed black lines depict exponential function fits to various centrality bins up to $m_{\rm T} = 3m_{0}$ and the fit function is shown below

\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2N}{2\pi m_{\rm T}dm_{\rm T}dy} = \frac{dN/dy}{2\pi T_{\rm eff}(m_0+T_{\rm eff})}e^{-(m_{\rm T}-m_0)/T_{\rm eff}}
\end{equation}

A power-law function (shown below) is also used to fit the spectrum in 60--80\% centrality bin. 

\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2N}{2\pi p_{\rm T}dp_{\rm T}dy} = \frac{dN}{dy}\frac{4(n-1)(n-2)}{2\pi (n-3)^2\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle ^2}\bigg(1+\frac{2p_{\rm T}}{\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle (n-3)}\bigg)^{-n}
\end{equation}

where $dN/dy$, $\langle p_{\rm T}\rangle$, and $n$ are three free parameters. 

The power-law function fit shows a good description ($x^{2}/ndf$ = 4.973/5 for power-law while the exponential gives $x^{2}/ndf$ = 4.717/6 with the fit range from $0 - 3$) to the 60--80\% centrality data indicating the $D^0$ meson production in this peripheral bin is close to the perturbative QCD feature. The $D^0$ meson spectra in more central collisions can be well described by the expotential function fit suggesting the $D^0$ mesons have gained collectivity in the medium evolution in these collisions.

Figure~\ref{Teff_D0} shows the $m_{\rm T}$ spectra slope parameter $T_{\rm eff}$ (obtained from the expontential fit described above) vs. collision centrality. Statistical and point-to-point systematic uncertainties, but no global systematic uncertainties, are added quadratically when performing the expontial fit. Therefore uncertainties shown in this plot are the total uncertainties on this fit parameter. The obtained $T_{\rm eff}$ parameter increases from peripheral to central collisions, suggesting more collectivity that $D^0$ mesons gain in more central collisions.

\label{Teff_ALL} 
\end{figure}


Blast-wave model is extensively used to study the particle kinetic freeze-out properties. 

Assuming a hard-sphere uniform density particle source with a kinetic freeze-out temperature $T_{\rm kin}$ and a transverse radial flow velocity $\beta$, the particle transverse momentum spectral shape is given by :

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{p_{\rm T}dp_{\rm T}} = \frac{dN}{m_{\rm T}dm_{\rm T}} \propto \int_0^R rdr m_{\rm T} I_0\bigg(\frac{p_{\rm T}\sinh\rho}{T_{\rm kin}}\bigg) K_1\bigg(\frac{m_{\rm T}\cosh\rho}{T_{\rm kin}}\bigg)
\end{equation}

where $\rho = \tanh^{-1}\beta$, and $I_0$ and $K_1$ are the modified Bessel functions. The flow velocity profile is taken as

\begin{equation}
\beta = \beta_{\rm S}\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^{n}
\end{equation}

where $\beta_{\rm S}$ is the maximum velocity at the surface and $r/R$ is the relative radial position in the thermal source. The choice of $R$ only affects the overall spectrum magnitude while the spectrum shape constrains the three free parameters $T_{\rm kin}$, $\langle\beta\rangle=2/(2+n)\beta_{\rm S}$ and $n$.


To account for the degree of non-equilibrium, Tsallis statistics has been introduced into the Blast-wave model with an additional parameter $q-1$, and the Blast-Wave distribution can be modified as

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{m_{\rm T}dm_{\rm T}} \propto m_{\rm T}\int_{-Y}^{+Y}\cosh(y)dy \int_{-\pi}^{+\pi} d\phi \int_0^R rdr \bigg(1+\frac{q-1}{T_{\rm kin}}\big(m_{\rm T}\cosh(y)\cosh(\rho)-p_{\rm T}\sinh(\rho)\cos(\phi)\big)\bigg)^{\textstyle -\frac{1}{q-1}}
\end{equation}

In the limit of $q\rightarrow 1$, the TBW distribution returns to the regular Blast-Wave one. The new Tsallis Blast-Wave (TBW) model has been used to fit the RHIC light and strange hadron spectra and it shows nice description of these particle spectra up to 3 GeV/$c$.

The TBW fit is also implement on $D^0$ to account the degree of non-equilibrium in a system. Results show similar trend as BW, the most central data point locate at the larger $\langle\beta\rangle$ value. While the $(q-1)$ parameter in TBW, which characterizes the degree of non-equilibrium in a system, shows a decrease trend with the increase centralities. The system is towards to thermalization with the centrality.


\subsection{\label{result:RCP}Nuclear Modification Factor - $R_{\rm CP}$ and  $R_{\rm AA}$}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.68\textwidth]{figure/Run14_D0HFT/D0_compareSpectra_run10.eps}
\caption{$D^{0}$ spectra compare with the run10/11 for different centrality classes in Au + Au collisions.}
\label{D0_compareSpectra_run10} 
\end{figure}

To calculate the $R_{AA}$, we need the p+p baseline measurements. Here, the baseline measurement was from STAR Run09 p+p results. It was combined of $D^0$ and $D^{*}$ measurement with consider the $p_T$ dependence of the $D^*$/$D^0$ ratio. It's kind of different compare to the previous publish result, but we just keep the same as the new run10/11 PRL erratum to select the p+p baseline. Details please find in the erratum note. Here we just want to clarify how the baseline and systematic uncertainty was chosen and calculated.

% The central value for p+p result was from the fitted Levy function. As can see, the levy function can describe the measured data quite well. In the whole $p_T$ range, we quote the 1 $\sigma$ band from the fitting as the systematic uncertainties source. For the unmeasured $p_T$ range, say $p_T <$ 1GeV and $>$ 6 GeV, together with the measured range, we have a consistent procedures to add an additional source from the different fitting functions. As can see in the low $p_T$ range, we have run12 preliminary results, the data do not favor power-law shape. Even though without run12 preliminary results, the pythia also do not favor the power-law. So in the low $p_T$ region (<$1 GeV$), we quote the different between levy and BW to consider as the additional systematic uncertainty source. The larger one between 1$\sigma$ band and Levy-BW difference was considered as the systematic uncertainty. In the high $p_T$ range, with our current knowledge, we can't drop those function shapes. So instead of just consider levy and BW, we also include power-low in the high $p_T$ rang, quote the maximum difference as the systematic source. The plots shown in Fig.~\ref{pp_baseLine1} and Fif.~\ref{pp_baseLine2}.

The central value for p+p result was from the fitted Levy function. As can see, the levy function can describe the measured data quite well. In the whole $p_T$ range, we quote the 1 $\sigma$ band from the fitting as the systematic uncertainties source. Due to the constrains from the function shape, the 1$\sigma$ band is kind of smaller compare to the data uncertainties in the measured pt range, but the error band in the unmeasured range is huge. For the unmeasured $p_T$ range, say $p_T <$ 1GeV and $>$ 6 GeV, together with the measured range, we have a consistent procedures to add an additional source from the different fitting functions. This is kind of systematic source from our limited knowledge of the spectra shapes. As can see we also have run12 preliminary results can be used as guidance spectra. In the low $p_T$ and high $p_T$ region (<$1 GeV$ and >$6 GeV$) together with the measured range ($ 1GeV$ < $p_{T}$ < $6 GeV$), we quote the difference between levy and powlaw to consider as the additional systematic uncertainty source. The plots shown in Fig.~\ref{pp_baseLine1} and Fif.~\ref{pp_baseLine2} are the p+p base lines. Note here The TBW fit parameters were obtained from fitting with strangeness particle spectra in peripheral 60-80\% and $D^0$+$D*$ in p+p together. And the TBW fit is just for a check and not included in the final results.

Fig.~\ref{pp_baseLine_ratio} and Fif.~\ref{pp_baseLine_ratio_3} are the p+p spectra divided to the levy functions. Red points were from run9 publish result while the Black ones are from run12. The band present the 1$\sigma$ fitting uncertainty for Fig.~\ref{pp_baseLine_ratio} while Fig.~\ref{pp_baseLine_ratio} also including the additional systematic source from other functions as described above.

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

After the baseline was processed, another question is how to propagate the AuAu uncertainties and pp baseline uncertainties to the final $R_{AA}$ uncertainties. Basically, there is an assumption here is that the two uncertainties from Au+Au and p+p follows the Gaussian distribution. Then what we did is simple, we just randomly sampling those two p+p and Au+Au distributions with a large samples, then calculation each $R_{AA}$ values and extract the $R_{AA}$ distributions. Then cumulated the $1\sigma$ ($\sim68\%$) range, and quota as the as-systematic uncertainties.

Fig.~\ref{D0_spectra_ratioposneg} shows the $\bar{D^{0}}|$/$D^{0}$ double ratio in the corresponding centrality species. With the current data, there is a hint that the $\bar{D^{0}}$ yield is relative larger than the $D^{0}$ in the most central and mid-central collisions. There could be some physics message behind, since we expect the $\bar{\Lambda_{c}^-}$/$\Lambda_{c}^+$ ratio should be smaller then unity due to the finite baryon density. The total charm quark and anti-charm quark should be conserved since they are created in pair, which results to the measured $\bar{D^0}$ larger than the $D^0$. This could also arise the precise measurements for $D^{+}$/$D^{-}$ and $D_{s}^{+}$/$D_{s}^{-}$ in the future.


\subsection{\label{result:theory}Comparison to Models}

Over the past several years, there have been rapid developments in the theory model calculations 

The Duke model uses a Langevin stochastic simulation to trace the charm quark propagation inside the QGP medium. Both collisional energy loss and radiative energy loss have been included in the calculation and charm quarks are hardronized via a hybrid approach combining both coalescence and fragmentation mechanisms. The bulk medium is simulated using a viscous hydrodynamic evoluation for the QGP evoluation and a hadronic cascade evolution using the UrQMD model. The charm quark in-medium interaction is characterized using a temperature and momentum dependent diffusion coefficient. The medium evoluation parameters have been constrained via a statistical Bayesian analysis by fitting the previous experimental data of $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_{2}$ of light, strange and charm hadrons. The extracted charm quark spatial diffusion coefficient at zero momentum $2\pi TD_s|_{p=0}$ is about 1--3 near $T_{\rm c}$ and exhibits a positive slope for its temperature dependence above $T_{\rm c}$.

The Linearized Boltzmann Transport (LBT) calculation extends the LBT approach developed before to include both light and heavy flavor parton evoluation in the QGP medium. The transport calculation includes all $2\rightarrow 2$ elastic scattering processes for collisional energy loss and the higher-twist energy loss formalism for medium induced radiative energy loss. It uses the same hybrid approach as in the Duke model for charm quark hadronization. The heavy quark transport is coupled with a 3D viscous hydrodynamic evolution which is tuned for light flavor hadron data. The charm quark spatial diffusion coefficient is estimated via the $2\pi TD_s =8\pi/\hat{q}$ at parton momentum $p = 10$\,GeV/$c$. The $2\pi TD_s$ is $\sim$3 at $T_{\rm c}$ and increases to $\sim$6 at $T = 500$\,MeV.

We compare our measured $R_{\rm CP}$ to several theory model calculations, shown in Fig.~\ref{D0_Rcp11} and Fig.~\ref{D0_Rcp22}. 

\subsection{\label{result:totalCC} Total ccbar cross section}

Relay on the current charm related analysis, there is a nature question regarding on the total charm cross section. So using the current D0, Dpm, Dstar and Lc results and also relay on some theory prediction for the non-measured pt range. The detail slides can be found below: and We are using 10-40\% centrality for this testing.
